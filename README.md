## Customization

### Showing more history.

By default, the widget shows only 5 events as a history. You can change this by setting `maxLength` property.

```dart
KeyboardMouseIndicator(
  alignment: Alignment.bottomLeft,
  showAsHistory: true,
  maxLength: 10, // Show recent 10 events
);
```

### Showing current keys pressed.

By default, the widget shows events as a history. You can change this by setting `showAsHistory` property to `false`.
It will show current keys pressed.

```dart
KeyboardMouseIndicator(
  alignment: Alignment.bottomLeft,
  showAsHistory: false,
);
```

### Manually clearing history/keys pressed.

You can clear the history/keys pressed by calling `clear` method on `KeyboardMouseController`.

1. Pass `KeyboardMouseController` to `KeyboardMouseIndicator` widget.

```dart

final controller = KeyboardMouseController();

KeyboardMouseIndicator(
  controller: controller,
  alignment: Alignment.bottomLeft,
  showAsHistory: true,
);
```

2. Call `clear` method on `KeyboardMouseController` to clear history/keys pressed.

```dart
controller.clear();
```

### Customizing mouse indicator widget.

You can customize the mouse indicator widget by passing `mouseIndicator` property to `KeyboardMouseIndicator` widget.

```dart
KeyboardMouseIndicator(
  controller: controller,
  alignment: Alignment.bottomLeft,
  showAsHistory: true,
  mouseIndicator: MouseIndicator(
    height: 72,
  ),
);
```

### Styling mouse indicator widget

You can style the mouse indicator widget by passing `style` property to `MouseIndicator` widget. `MouseIndicatorStyle`
has two types: `MouseIndicatorStyle.filled` and `MouseIndicatorStyle.outlined`.
By default, it is `MouseIndicatorStyle.outlined`.

```dart
KeyboardMouseIndicator(
  controller: controller,
  alignment: Alignment.bottomLeft,
  showAsHistory: true,
  mouseIndicator: MouseIndicator(
    height: 72,
    style: MouseIndicatorStyle.outlined(

      showScrollButton: true,
      scrollButtonWidth: 48,
      buttonsHeightFactor: 0.5,
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
